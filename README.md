# Advent of Code 2022 - Go

## Run with your own input

For example day 1, part 1:
1. Copy your puzzle input to `day1/input.txt`
2. Run `go run . day1-1`

## Test
Each day contains 2 test files, one for each part of the day. There's a test for the sample data and a test for the real data I got from AoC. Obviously, that test fails when you use your input file.
